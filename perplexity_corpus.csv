cj50_0," Unfortunately , however , and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues . And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service . One such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs . Here , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma ."
cf08_37," One such wife , Dr. Linden says , became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man . But her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover , too , had been conquered and reduced to passivity . Then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list ."
cl06_11," The kick came , sudden and vicious but short . Mickey's guts twisted with the effort , but he kept his eye on the weapon . It moved in a silver arc toward his throat , then veered downward . He hunched his left shoulder into it and slashed at Roberts' forearm with his own , felt the blade slide off his sleeve . Before Roberts could move inside to cut upward toward his face , he slammed his right fist into Roberts' belly . Roberts sagged and slashed at him wildly . Ducking , Mickey tripped and fell to one side , landing heavily on the wood floor . Then Roberts was on him , gasping for breath and for a couple of seconds Mickey lost sight of the blade . He felt it rip at the side of his jacket and a momentary sting under his left ribs . He got a knee up into Roberts' belly , used both hands and heaved him clear , then scrambled to his feet . They were in the center of the lobby now . Still clutching the razor , Roberts came up into a crouch , shaking his head . When he charged Mickey was ready . He hit Roberts with his left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him feebly , then wobbled in mid-air . With his right fist , and nearly all his weight behind it , he smashed at the bloodstained face ."
cl06_28," In the garage he checked the Jeep for signs of the use he had made of it . There were stains here and there and he cleaned them off , using an oiled rag he found on a nail . He wiped the steering wheel and all the places he might have touched the Jeep . He replaced the flashlight where it had been stowed , got into his own car and backed it out of the garage . There were tire marks where it had been , but they were overlapped by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny . Liz Peabody , he thought , might spend some time grieving for her lost lover , but he doubted that she would launch an investigation . He judged her to be a woman of some pride , though not much sense . Still she would probably have sense enough not to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who , apparently , had run away ."
cf30_4," Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal sang-froid . For example , groups regularly canoe down the Connecticut River . This is in honor of John Ledyard , class of 1773 , who scooped a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in his own student days . And these hardy travelers are not unappreciated today . They are hailed by the nation's press , and Smith girls throng the riverbanks at Northampton and refresh the voyageurs with hot soup and kisses ."
cf30_20," Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today , with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates . But it has achieved a cross-section of students from almost all the states , and two-thirds of its undergraduates come from outside New England . Over 450 different schools are usually represented in each entering class . Only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students , and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single delegation . About two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools ."
cj61_4," For the use of students and future restorers , a full , day-by-day record was kept of all three undertakings , complete technical reports on what we found and what we did . These may be consulted in the office of the Architect of the Capitol , or the Library of Congress ."
cj59_0," Rather than being deceived , the eye is puzzled ; ; instead of seeing objects in space , it sees nothing more than -- a picture ."
cj59_10," Analytical Cubism came to an end in the collage , but not conclusively ; ; nor did Synthetic Cubism fully begin there . Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil , and transformed by this translation , did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat , interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to , if not the illusion of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities ."
cj66_8," What Parker and his contemporaries -- Gillespie , Davis , Monk , Roach ( Tristano is an anomaly ) , etc. -- did was to absorb the musical ornamentation of the older jazz into the basic structure , of which it then became an integral part , and with which it then developed . This is true of the melodic line which could be put together from selected passages of almost anybody -- Benny Carter , Johnny Hodges . It is true of the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts continuously , or at least is continuously sprung , so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be dominated by the long pulsations of the phrase or strophe . This is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque to rococo music . It is the difference between Bach and Mozart ."
cj66_15," The point is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays are aberrant , idiosyncratic . There is no longer any sense of continuing development of the sort that can be traced from Baudelaire to Eluard , or for that matter , from Hawthorne through Henry James to Gertrude Stein . The cubist generation before World War 1 , , and , on a lower level , the surrealists of the period between the wars , both assumed an accepted universe of discourse , in which , to quote Andre Breton , it was possible to make definite advances , exactly as in the sciences . I doubt if anyone holds such ideas today . Continuity exits , but like the neo-swing music developed from Lester Young , it is a continuity sustained by popular demand ."
cj66_18," A process of elimination which leaves the artist with nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest in either artist or public for very long . So , in the last couple of years , abstract expressionism has tended toward romantic suggestion -- indications of landscape or living figures ."
cj32_4," Text lookup , as we will describe it , consists of three steps . The first is compiling a list of text forms , assigning an information cell to each , and replacing text occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each occurrence . For this step the computer memory is separated into three regions : cells in the W-region are used for storage of the forms in the text-form list ; ; cells in the X-region and Y region are reserved as information cells for text forms ."
ch07_2," There are forty-seven special district governments in Rhode Island ( excluding two regional school districts , four housing authorities , and the Kent County Water Authority ) . These forty-seven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes , to borrow money , own property , sue and be sued , and in general to exercise normal corporate powers . Unlike cities and towns , however , they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state Bureau of Audits . It is not an exaggeration to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government . In addition to the collection of service charges , the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $450,000 ."
ch07_18," The uniform fiscal year brings the town's fiscal year into line with that of the schools , which expend the largest share of local disbursements . This greatly simplifies the town's bookkeeping and financial reporting . 5 ."
ch07_19," The uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes . Furthermore , tax collections not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes , augmenting the town's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax levy . 6 ."
cj35_4," It will be seen that where the scope is similar , the Athabascan ratios come out somewhat higher ( as indeed they ought to with a total ratio of 2.8 as against 3.5 or 4 : 5 ) except for verbs , where alone the Athabascan ratio is lower . This exception may be connected with Hoijer's use of a much higher percentage of verbs : 22% of his total list as against 3.5% in mine . Or the exception may be due to a particular durability peculiar to the Athabascan verb . More word class ratios determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the question ."
cj35_11," Thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving an index of persistence , which weights not only the number of stems ( ' roots ' ) per meaning , but their relative frequency . Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning are : stem identical in 8 languages , 100% ; ; stem frequencies 7 and 1 , 86% ; ; stem frequencies 4 and 4 , 64% ; ; stem frequencies 4 , 3 , and 1 , 57% . His formula will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies of material . But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance ; ; and Gleason presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area ."
cj35_14," These findings , and others which will in time be developed , will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry . If adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems , as I am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world , why should our basic lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms , but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly ? ? Had Hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items , his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan language separation smaller . And irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting , calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones ."
cb09_26," So successful has been this program , worked out by white and Negro civic leaders , that further extensions are expected in the next few months . Hotels , for example , are ready to let down the bars . Already , at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis . Several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis ."
cj58_19," Resolved , that we find in this fearful tragedy at Harper's Ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible ."
cn03_39," His shout had been taken up and repeated . The guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses . All were carrying guns they had seized up , but they were half-clad or hardly clad at all ."
cn03_41," Mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings . He crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner . The area was deserted . A man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to Mike's left , but he , too , suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade ."
cn03_46," He shouldered the blanket again , backed off , and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon . He turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house ."
cn03_53, The wagons were burning fiercely . The mudwagon had caught fire also . The blaze was spreading to the frame buildings .
cl09_49," Again the homely , everyday details of daily living refuted a vicious attempt to frighten her -- or to murder her ."
cf07_19," When no medical problems exist , the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves . Special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value . Folk-lore , superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints ."
cf07_23," In fact , the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon ."
cn04_12," For , unlike the Sioux and the Crows , the Aricaras are not great horsemen , nor are they aggressive like the savage Blackfeet . More of an agricultural nation , they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains . Still , I was disgusted with myself for agreeing with Montero's methods ."
cj69_20," The DA statement is used to name and define the positions and length of fields within an area . The DC statement is used to name and enter constants into the object program . Since the 7070 and 7074 make use of record definition words ( RDWS ) to read , write , move , and otherwise examine blocks of storage , the DA and DC statements provide the option of generating RDWS automatically . When so instructed , Autocoder will generate one or more RDWS and assign them successive locations immediately preceding the area with which they are to be associated . An RDW will be of the form Af , where xxxx is the starting location of the area and yyyy is its ending location . These addresses are calculated automatically by the processor ."
cf31_3," Lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders , she had been disturbed by their voices and had closed her door , even though it was a very hot day ."
cj56_28," The Colonial Light and Power Company was succeeded by the Vermont Hydro-Electric Corporation , which in turn was absorbed by the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation . The latter now furnishes the area with electricity distributed from a modern sub-station at Manchester Depot which was put into operation February 19 , 1930 and was improved in January 1942 by the installation of larger transformers ."
cj56_29," For a time following the abandonment of the local plant , electric current for Manchester was brought in from the south with an emergency tie-in with the Vermont Marble Company system to the north ."
cl07_6," He figured his best bet was a call on the sheriff . A clerk in the outer office took him in to Sheriff Carruthers , a big , paunchy man with thick , white hair and a voice with a senatorial resonance which suggested he should be running for higher office ."

cj05_5," Physical chemistry of washing Although there is no question but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the present , this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces . The purpose of washing is , obviously , to remove soils which are arbitrarily classed in the four major categories given below : 1 ."
cj05_9," Miscellaneous soils , which primarily include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave a residue ."
cb06_10," Further , do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo ? ? They will -- when they give up the donkey and the elephant . Instead of attempting the impossible , why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger's stripes are not black ? ? That might go over ."
ch08_2," On April 30 , ceremonies commemorating the departure of these volunteers will take place at 1:00 P.M. at the Dexter Training Grounds in Providence . The Independence Day celebration will be properly observed with a big military and civic parade from West Warwick to the Greene Homestead in Anthony ; ; and now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim the week of april 29th to may 7th , 1961 , as Rhode Island Heritage Week , advising our citizens that throughout this week many historic houses and beautiful gardens will be open to visitors as well as industrial plants , craft shops , museums and libraries and I earnestly urge all to take advantage of these opportunities to see as many of these places as they can during this outstanding week ."
cj02_0," Abstract Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas ( Argon ) . Thus , the energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into the arc . It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15% of the total arc energy . A detailed energy balance of the anode was established . The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount . The dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 100 Amp and 200 Aj . Qualitative observations were made and high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the arc at various mass flow velocities ."

cb01_15, The danger lay not in believing that our own A-bombs would deter Russia's use of hers ; ; that theory was and is sound . The danger lay in the American delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough .
ce13_9," At the beginning of the Hippodrome I saw the Kaiser's Fountain , an ugly octagonal building with a glass dome , built in 1895 by the German Emperor , and on my left , directly across from it , the tomb of Sultan Ahmet , who constructed the Blue Mosque , more properly known by his name ."
ce25_15," Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy . The travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second ; ; thus it takes about 16 Msec. to traverse 25 mm. of tissue . A sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue evaluation . In addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique . The Doppler effect , using ultrasonic signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel ."
ce22_1," The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the United States of America was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur -- and very capable as a professional musician . These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-World War 1 , era . Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor in America was , indeed , brilliant ."
cg10_8," One is tempted to say that , on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles , the worst war of the Nineteenth century was fought . But though the Southern States , when drafting a constitution to unite themselves , narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede , the fact remained that by seceding from the Union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states . If the Union conceded this to them , the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede : This would destroy the federal balance between it and the states , and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their Union ."
ck23_3," She signed the letters quickly , stamped them , and placed them on the hall table for Raphael to mail in town . Then she went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water ."
ck23_11," She was the last living of the older generation . What had once been a widespread family -- at one time , she knew , there were enough Packards to populate an entire county -- had now narrowed down to the two boys , Abel and Mark . She swung her eyes up to the blue of the window , her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans . What hope lay in the nephews , she asked the intensifying light out there , with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced , having sired two girl children , with none to bear on the Packard name ? ?"

ck24_50," Oh , he was being queer and careful , pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm . He was awful angry because he'd thought Ma was going to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her I know him I know him we felt the same sometimes while Ma wasn't thinking about that at all , not anything like that . There was no way of getting even . It wasn't like getting cheated at the fair . They were always trying so you got to expect it . Now Hans had given Ma something of his -- we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa -- something valuable ; ; but since she didn't know we'd given it to her , there was no easy way of getting it back ."
cg43_10," I would say , too , that the study of literature tends to give a person what I shall call depth . I use this term to mean three things : a search for the human significance of an event or state of affairs , a tendency to look at wholes rather than parts , and a tendency to respond to these events and wholes with feeling . It is the obverse of triviality , shallowness , emotional anaesthesia . I think these attributes cluster , but I have no evidence . In fact , I can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure to literary art ."

cg75_12," The English lady really wanted to put a wreath on the Garibaldi monument on the 30th of April . She had her reasons for this . For one thing , there wasn't going to be any ceremony at all this year . There were a few reasons for that , too : Garibaldi had been taken up and exploited by the Communists nowadays . Therefore the government wanted no part of him . ( It is sort of as if our government should decide to disown Washington or Lincoln for the same reason . ) And then there were ecclesiastical matters , the matter of Garibaldi's anti-clericalism . There was a new Pope and the Vatican was making itself heard and felt these days . As it happens the English lady is a good Catholic herself , but of more liberal political persuasion . Nothing was going to be done this year to celebrate Garibaldi's bold and unsuccessful defense of Rome . All that the English lady wanted to do was to walk up to the monument and lay a wreath at its base . This would show that somebody , even a foreigner living in Rome , cared . And then there were other things . Some of the marble busts in the park are of young Englishmen who fought and died for Garibaldi . She also mentioned leaving a little bunch of flowers at the bust of Lauro Di Bosis ."
ck15_2," They put Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent for the young Presbyterian minister . He sat beside Kate's bed with the others throughout the morning , talking , talking of God's will , while Kate lay staring angrily at him . When he told her God had called the child to Him , she rejected his words rebelliously ."
ck15_5," Jonathan's letter came , as she knew it would , and he had accepted their child's death as another judgment from God against both Kate and himself . In blind panic of grief she accepted Jonathan's dictum , and believed in her desperation that she had been cursed by God . She held Jonathan's letter , his words burning like a brand , and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were severed . She had nothing left but her duty to his land and his son . Joel came and sat mutely with her , sharing her pain and anguish , averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom ."

ca24_57," Dr. Hester , also one of the youngest men ever to head a major American university , succeeds Dr. Carroll V. Newsom who resigned last September to join Prentice-Hall Inc. publishing firm ."
cg11_5," I think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city . If an automobile were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even though he might not be able to act quickly enough . With the group of boys it is different . He does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side , to cross the street , or to continue on the same side . When confronted with a drunk or an insane person I have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others . I believe that what I do has some effect on his actions and I have learned , in a way , to commune with drunks , but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics . I am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose . Our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise . We are forced , in our behavior towards others , to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements ."
ca40_2," Old and new briefly crossed paths in the U.S. Senate , then went their respective ways . At a reception for new members of Congress , Oregon Democrat Maurine Neuberger , taking the Senate seat held by her husband Richard until his death last March , got a brotherly buss from Democratic Elder Statesman Adlai Stevenson , U.S. Ambassador-designate to the U.N. . Meanwhile , after 24 years in the Senate , Rhode Island's durable Democrat Theodore Francis Greene -- having walked , swum and cerebrated himself to the hearty age of 93 -- left that august body ( voluntarily , because he could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last November ) , as the oldest man ever to serve in the Senate ."

cc17_8," Americans eat too much fat . With meat , milk , butter and ice cream , the calorie-heavy U.S. diet is 40% fat , and most of that is saturated fat -- the insidious kind , says Dr. Keys , that increases blood cholesterol , damages arteries , and leads to coronary disease ."
cc17_21," When thus deposited , Keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks . Explains Keys : As the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream , they are deposited in the intima , or inner wall of a coronary artery . The proteins and fats are burned off , and the cholesterol is left behind . As cholesterol piles up , it narrows , irritates and damages the artery , encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation . Eventually , says Keys , one of two things happens . A clot forms at the site , seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes a heart attack . Or ( more commonly , thinks Keys ) the deposits themselves get so big that they choke off the artery's flow to the point that an infarct occurs : the heart muscle is suffocated , cells supplied by the artery die , and the heart is permanently , perhaps fatally injured ."
cc17_24," During World War 2 , , doctors in The Netherlands and Scandinavia noted a curious fact : despite the stresses of Nazi occupation , the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping . Not until long after the war -- 1950 , in fact -- did they get a hint of the reason . That year , Sweden's Haqvin Malmros showed that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods . That same year the University of California's Dr. Laurance Kinsell , timing oxidation rates of blood fats , stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically , while animal fats cause them to rise . Here Keys and others , such as Dr. A. E. Ahrens of the Rockefeller Institute , took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fats -- and even between different varieties of each ."

ca13_32, And so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants' Willie Mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree Sunday .
ca13_45," This is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you're an American or National fan and anti or pro-Yankee . The record books , however , would favor the Giants' ace ."
cg45_16," Hearst won the Iowa state convention , but ran into a bitter battle in Indiana before losing to Parker , drawing an angry statement from Indiana's John W. Kern :"

ca31_41," When he attended the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade school here about six months ago , Jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it ."
cc03_27," Their singing was well-balanced , clear and , within obvious limitations , extremely pleasing . The limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices -- an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity , an occasional waver and now and then a bleat ."
cc04_28," Sparrow-size Virginia Gibson , with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile , made a suitably perky Amy , while Melisande Congdon , as the real aunt , was positively monumental in the very best Gibson Girl manner ."
ca36_5," Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric , Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market . The industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied ."
cg60_10, I went to visit Alfred in the Kingston Hospital a few times . The first time I went there he asked me to bring him water from Flagler's well -- water that reminded him of his first days in the mountains -- and before I came the next time I filled a five-gallon jug for him and brought it to the hospital . I don't think he ever got to drink any of it .
ca09_44, The commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project .
ca07_9," In talks with Mr. Buckley last week in Washington , the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent to dropping Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa , who lives in the Bronx , from this year's ticket . But Mr. Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr. Gerosa's successor ."
ca07_10," Screvane and Beame hailed The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr. Screvane , who lives in Queens , to replace Abe Stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr. Beame , who lives in Brooklyn , to replace Mr. Gerosa as the candidate for Controller ."

ce30_64," Choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans . There are two sides of a coin for this decision . Workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to . And they can at least collect the money they put in , plus interest , when they leave the company . A non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he retires . Thus , there is an added incentive to stay on the job ."
ce06_19," As the ungoverned days of the automobile and the airplane are long since relegated to the past , so is the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do ; ; must and should do . However , there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating ."
ce06_20," Laws on boating vary according to the state in which the craft is to be used and according to its horsepower . What may be acceptable in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line . The main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally used . If your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure boats , you must apply for a number from the U.S. Coast Guard for any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower before it can be used on Federal waterways ."
cm02_0," The expense and time involved are astronomical . However , we sent a third vessel out , a much smaller and faster one than the first two . We have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago ; ; that is all I can tell you about them ."

There was much shouting and screaming . Fights sprang up and were quickly squelched . Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together ."
ck08_10," But at the same time how understandable . How could the rich , for whom life was made so simple , ever understand the subterfuges , the lies , the frauds , the errors , sins and even crimes to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the race of life ? ?"
ck08_13," Ever since he had first begun to study music and to teach it , Rousseau had dreamed of piercing through to fame as the result of a successful opera . But his facility in this genre was not great . And his efforts to get a performance for his Gallant Muses invariably failed . And for good reasons . His operatic music had little merit ."

ca37_17," Privately , the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage . Privately , they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon . In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress , and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not binding ."
ck06_17," Port Jervis , basking in the foothills , was the city of God . The Dutch Reformed Church , with two steeples and its own school was on Main Street ; ; the Episcopal Church was one block down Sussex Street ; ; the Catholic Saint Mary's Church , with an even taller steeple and a cross on top , stood on Ball Street . The Catholics had the largest cemetery , near the Neversink River where Main Street ran south ; ; Stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds ."
ck06_39," After the storm , the sky cleared blue and cool , and fragrant air swept the hills . When the sun came out , Stevie strode proudly into Orange Square , smiling like a landlord on industrious tenants . The fountain had brimmed over , the cannon were wet , the soldiers' monument glistened . Even before the benches had dried , the Civil War veterans were straggling back to their places . The great spire shone as if the lightning had polished it . He jumped . The pointed shadow had nearly touched him ."
ca08_8," Pennsylvania Avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint . But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it ."
ca08_35," Now , the picture is clouded , and even US Sens. James O. Eastland and John C. Stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status ."
ca08_52, This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash . It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year .
ca30_45," For instance , the Edwin Pauleys Jr. , formerly of Chantilly Rd. , are now at home on North Arden Dr. in Beverly Hills ."
ck01_12," Thirty-four the days seemed short , perhaps because his routine was , each day , almost the same . He rose late and went down in his bathrobe and slippers to have breakfast either alone or with Rachel . Virginia treated him with attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special food : biscuits , cookies , candies -- the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen . She would hover over him and , looking like her brother , anxiously watch the progress of Scotty's fork or spoon ."
ck01_38," The exchange was almost invariable , and Scotty , in his bed , could hear every word of it . He never smiled . It required an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical about his father . His father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and look at his son . After a pause , during which he studied Scotty's face as if Scotty were not there and could not study him too , Mr. McKinley would ask the same questions he had asked downstairs ."
cg35_20," Because of its wealth of experience , the Organization for European Economic Cooperation could help with the initial studies needed . The goal is to enlist all available economic resources in the industrialized Free World , especially private investment capital ."
cg35_28," To meet situations of less than general nuclear war , we continue to maintain our carrier forces , our many service units abroad , our always ready Army strategic forces and Marine Corps divisions , and the civilian components . The continuing modernization of these forces is a costly but necessary process . It is scheduled to go forward at a rate which will steadily add to our strength ."
cg35_31," We note that , first , America has already made great contributions in the past two years to the world's fund of knowledge of astrophysics and space science . These discoveries are of present interest chiefly to the scientific community ; ; but they are important foundation stones for more extensive exploration of outer space for the ultimate benefit of all mankind ."
cg35_37," A year ago , when I met with you , the nation was emerging from an economic downturn , even though the signs of resurgent prosperity were not then sufficiently convincing to the doubtful .

And millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition , designed for today's hunting and target shooting ."
ce31_7," The Outdoor Education Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life . The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development . But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman ."
ce31_18," With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now . There were umbrella tents , wall tents , cottage tents , station wagon tents , pup tents , Pop tents , Baker tents , tents with exterior frames , camper trailers , travel trailers , and even a few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps ."
cp14_4," George Rawlings remembered seeing the door open sometime during the night -- Millie , in a white robe , standing like a ghost at the threshold . She had vanished ; ; he must have slept again . He was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him . It seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch ; ; but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this Monday morning . This room was like a prison . He would not be indebted to Sam ! ! Below him , as if at the end of some remote tunnel , he heard the humming of a vacuum cleaner . His fingers fumbled across the bandages . They had left both of his eyes uncovered . Well , he told himself , let's put the show on the road ."
cp14_48," Someone laughed . George walked steadily ahead into his entry . His bandages seemed on fire . He had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it . In the kitchenette the raw whiskey made him gasp . Just one or two swallows , he told himself , enough to lessen some of the pain ."

If , in a certain part of the range , it starts life 1 foot longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giants , and reaches maturity at , let us guess , 18 inches longer than the others , a quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of ( nearly ) 40 feet ."
cj11_4," I cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity growth ; ; at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches rather than feet . Until better records have been kept over longer periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions , it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions ."
cb15_27, Words cannot tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service gave to me . The concern they felt for me was such as I shall never forget and for which I will always be grateful .
cb15_38," We veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at VA hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness . Nevertheless , we wonder at the stand of the A.M.A. on the health problem confronting the aged . They opposed the Forand bill , which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction ; ; yet they supported the Eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars ( matched incidentally by a federal grant ) to initiate ."
ch24_1," If the last day ( due date ) for performing any act for tax purposes , such as filing a return or making a tax payment , etc. , falls on Saturday , Sunday , or a legal holiday , you may perform that act on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday , Sunday , or legal holiday .

cj16_10," Specific staining by DEAE-cellulose treated Af and Af , although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells , was not satisfactorily photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts with black and white and color photography . This was chiefly because of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells . The autofluorescence from the walls of the xylem cells was particularly brilliant . Distribution of virus antigen Results of specific staining by the direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the localization of WTV antigen in certain tissues of tumors . The virus antigen was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue . Frequently a few isolated thick-walled cells or , rarely , groups of such cells in the xylem region , were also specifically stained , but there was no such staining in epidermis , cortex , most xylem cells , ray cells , or pith ."
ch15_6," Bricks are an alternative . If they are used , the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give the same protection as the 8-inch solid concrete blocks ."
ch15_15," Another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction . It would add about $500 to the total cost of the home . The shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such a room built in a new home in the Washington , D.C. area in the Spring of 1959 ."
ch15_25," Lighting is an important consideration . Continuous low-level lighting may be provided in the shelter by means of a 4-cell hot-shot battery to which is wired a 150-milliampere flashlight-type bulb . Tests have shown that such a device , with a fresh battery , will furnish light continuously for at least 10 days . With a spare battery , a source of light for 2 weeks or more would be assured . A flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a brighter light is needed . There should be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many areas ."
ch15_50, A family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation . On the ground floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside . The best protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house .
cj73_1," 2-2 . Crystal data organization : The present edition of crystal data was written by J.D.H. Donnay , the Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , Md. ( Part 2 ) ) and Werner Nowacki , University of Berne , Switzerland ( Part 1 ) ) with the collaboration of Gabrielle Donnay , U. S. Geological Survey , Washington , D. C. . Many collaborators in the United States and Switzerland helped in collecting and assembling data , in making calculations , and in editing . Support came from academic and industrial groups in these two countries . The Geological Society of America gave a grant-in-aid to complete the work and bore the expenses of publication . Preparation of a second edition is in progress under the sponsorship of the Crystal Data Committee of the American Crystallographic Association . Coeditors are J.D.H. Donnay , G. E. Cox of Leeds University , and Olga Kennard of the National Council for Medical Research , London . Financial grants have been received from the National Science Foundation and the ( British ) Institute of Physics for the compilation work and the publication costs . The continuity of the project is suggested by plans for an eventual third edition . Substances : Elements , alloys , inorganic and organic compounds . ( Metal data will not be included in the second edition , since these have been collected independently by W. B. Pearson , National Research Council , Ottawa , and published as A handbook of lattice spacings and structures of metals and alloys by Pergamon Press . ) properties : Crystallographic data resulting mainly from X-ray and electron diffraction measurements are presented . Cell dimensions , number of formula units per cell , space group , and specific gravity are given for all substances . For some substances , auxiliary properties such as the melting point are given . Sources of data : Part 1 , of the present edition covers the literature to mid-1948 ; ; Part 2 , , up to the end of 1951 . Much of the material comes directly from secondary sources such as Strukturbericht . Criticality : The vast number of compounds to be covered , the limited resources to do the job , and the immediate need for this type of compilation precluded a thorough evaluation of all available data in the present edition . Future editions may be more critical . Use of nomenclature , symbols , units , physical constants : Since Parts 1 , and 2 , were prepared independently , the abbreviation schemes and the chemical symbols used differ in the two parts . The second edition should have greater uniformity . Currency : A second edition is in preparation , and there are long range plans for a third . Format : Data in the present edition are presented in tables and lists . Part 1 , deals with the classification of crystalline substances by space groups and is not a numerical data compilation . The compounds are divided according to composition into seven categories . Part 2 , contains determinative tables for the identification of crystalline substances . These are arranged according to crystal system . There are formula and name indexes covering both parts . References for Part 1 , are given at the end and for Part 2 , in the tables . Publication and distribution : The present edition of crystal data ( Af ) , published in 1954 as Memoir 60 of the Geological Society of America , is now out of print . The manuscript of the second edition will probably be ready by the end of 1960 ."

cj80_6," It must be noticed in Fig. 7-1 that the accelerometer responds to any input acceleration . The equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle is Af . In practice , the preflight leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the airframe . When the system is arranged for automatic leveling , the platform angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on the accelerometers . There are many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind gusts , engine noise , turbulence around the vehicle , etc. . One of the greatest problems associated with automatic leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of high-level acceleration noise . One solution to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include low-pass filters . This technique causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform tilt . Since a lower loop gain and low-pass filtering increases the response time , a practical compromise must be reached ."

cl22_0," In good time I shall get to the distressing actuality , to Red McIver and Handley Walker , to murder and sudden death . But you realize , I am sure , how much old deeds incite to new ones , and you must forgive me if I tell you first of the old ones ."
cn10_5," She wondered what had taken place in town , between him and his wife . She wished that she could talk to her mother about it . Not that her mother knew what had happened , but they could speculate upon it . But her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it , and say that it was none of her concern ."
cn10_9," At the moment , the three men were not saying much of anything . They were sitting on their heels , rider-fashion , over by the still empty calf wagon . Brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel , with the other two facing him . He held a cigarette in his right hand . It was burning away , forgotten . His face was clouded with unhappiness ."

cf13_31, Discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm . Location nearness to work . -- Choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities . Then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell the farm . The presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable .
cd17_2," When you read me , you are holding in your hands the product of many minds and hearts . Some of the people who speak through my pages are famous ; ; others unknown . Some work with their hands . Some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope .

cj45_14," The questionnaire provided a place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification of the respondent was optional . The questionnaire also stated that , in any event , all replies would be treated confidentially . It is interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the questionnaire identified themselves ."
cj45_33," The first step in processing was to analyze the returns from Questions 1 , 2 , and 3 to determine whether the respondents were large businesses or small businesses , in accordance with the definitions contained in ASPR Section 1-701 . ( see Chapter 2 . ) The results are shown in Table 3 ."
cl13_22," He tried to ignore what his own common sense told him , but it wasn't possible ; ; her motives were too blatant . She wanted him to get into trouble . She wanted the police to notice him , suspect him . She was going to keep on scheming , poking , prodding , suggesting , and dictating until the cops got up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions . And he knew in that moment , with a cold sinking of despair , a dying of old hopes , that Mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors . Nothing bald , open ; ; but enough . They'd have some suspicions to repeat to the police ."
cl13_35," It wasn't what Mae would want him to do , though . He was sure of this . Once he had abandoned himself to the very worst , once he had quieted all the dragons of worry and suspense , there wouldn't be very much for Mae to do . At that moment , Holden almost slammed on the brakes to go back to Cooper and ask if Ferguson was about ."
cf41_3," Start on the Via D. Teatro Di Marcello at the foot of the Capitoline Hill . The majestic circular tiers of stone of the Theatre of Marcellus give you some idea of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus erected in 13 B.C. . Twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in Roman days . Andrea Palladio , an Italian architect of the sixteenth century , modeled his designs on its Doric and Ionic columns ."
cf41_12," At this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio Emanuele 2 , , walk along the Corso Del Rinascimento a couple of hundred yards , then turn left on the Via Dei Canestrani to enter the splendid Piazza Navona , one of the truly glorious sights in Rome ."
cf41_14," The site of the oblong piazza is Domitian's ancient stadium , which was probably used for horse and chariot races . For centuries it was the location of historic festivals and open-air sports events . From the seventeenth to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in the summer , and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated square in their carriages ."
cf41_17," Take the Via Di S. Agnese in Agone , next to the church and opposite the center of the square , then turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the beautiful Church of Santa Maria Della Pace .

ch14_21," Determine if the particular State's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is less than its minimum ( base ) allotment , and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment . Regardless of its unadjusted allotment , each State is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954 -- increased by a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which brings total 1954 allotments to all States up to $23,000,000 . 14 ."
ch14_22," The funds recouped by reductions in item 12 above are used : first , to increase the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those States where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment ( item 13 above ) ; ; and second , to increase uniformly the allotments to those States whose allotments are below their maximums , with adjustments to prevent the allotment of any State from thereby exceeding its maximum . Additional note on allotments ."
cj26_1," The regulations require the inscription of each individual ( male or female , adult or child ) on a separate card ( fiche ) . The cards , filed by circonscription ( sub-chiefdom , or village ) , are kept in the headquarters of each territoire ( chiefdom ) . Each card is expected to show certain information about the individual concerned , including his or her date of birth ( or age at a specified time ) , spouses , and children . Additional entries must be made from time to time . Different cards are used for males and females , and a corner is clipped from the cards of adults , and of children when they reach puberty . So a quick count could be made at any time , even by an illiterate clerk , of the number of registered persons in four age-and-sex classes . Personal identification cards are issued to all adult males on which tax payments , inoculations , periods of employment , and changes of residence are recorded . Similar identification cards were issued in 1959 to all adult females . Each adult is held personally responsible for assuring his inscription and obtaining an identification card which must be shown on demand . The registration card of a person leaving his home territory for a short period is put into a special file for absent persons . The cards of permanent out-migrants are , in theory , sent to an office in the place of new residence . Finally , the registration of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory in most regions ."
cj26_16," The first sampling census in the Congo extended over a three-year period , 1955 - 57 ; ; the results were still being processed in 1959 .

cb14_20," Errors repeated The present Republican leadership as practiced by Mundt , Goldwater , Bridges , Dirksen , et al , is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the 1930s . In that decade the partisan zeal to defend Mr. Hoover , and the party's failure to anticipate or cope with the depression , caused a great majority of Americans to see the Republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash ."

ch22_22," With respect to Article 2 , , Paragraph 1 ( A ) of the Agreement : ( 1 ) The Government of India will provide facilities for the conversions of the rupee equivalent of $4 million ( up to a maximum of $1 million per year ) accruing under the subject agreement for agricultural market development purposes into currencies other than United States dollars on request of the Government of the United States of America . This facility is needed for the purpose of securing funds to finance agricultural market development activities of the Government of the United States in other countries ."
ch22_23," The Government of the United States of America may utilize rupees in India to pay for goods and services , including international transportation needed in connection with market development and other agricultural projects and activities in India and other countries . ( 2 ) The rupee equivalent of $63.8 million , but not more than 5 percent of the currencies received under the Agreement will be used for loans to be made by the Export-Import Bank of Washington under Section 104 ( E ) of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act , as amended ( hereinafter referred to as the Act ) , and for administrative expenses of the Export-Import Bank of Washington in India incident thereto . It is understood that : ( A ) Such loans under Section 104 ( E ) of the Act will be made to United States business firms and branches , subsidiaries , or affiliates of such firms in India for business development and trade expansion in India and to United States firms and to Indian firms for the establishment of facilities for aiding in the utilization , distribution , or otherwise increasing the consumption of and markets for United States agricultural products . In the event the rupees set aside for loans under Section 104 ( E ) of the Act are not advanced within six years from the date of this Agreement because the Export-Import Bank of Washington has not approved loans or because proposed loans have not been mutually agreeable to the Export-Import Bank of Washington and the Department of Economic Affairs of the Government of India , the Government of the United States of America may use the rupees for any purpose authorized by Section 104 of the Act .

The Secretary , Department of Economic Affairs , or his designate , will act for the Government of India , and the President of the Export-Import Bank of Washington , or his designate , will act for the Export-Import Bank of Washington .

( D ) When the Export-Import Bank is prepared to act favorably upon an application , it will so notify the Department of Economic Affairs and will indicate the interest rate and the repayment period which would be used under the proposed loan . The interest rate will be similar to those prevailing in India on comparable loans and the maturities will be consistent with the purposes of the financing . ( E ) Within sixty days after the receipt of notice that the Export-Import Bank is prepared to act favorably upon an application the Department of Economic Affairs will indicate to the Export-Import Bank whether or not the Department of Economic Affairs has any objection to the proposed loan . Unless within the sixty-day period the Export-Import Bank has received such a communication from the Department of Economic Affairs it shall be understood that the Department of Economic Affairs has no objection to the proposed loan . When the Export-Import Bank approves or declines the proposed loan , it will notify the Department of Economic Affairs . 2 ."

cf15_10," Catholics , Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning , but disagree over the methods to be used . The Roman Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method , also known as the use of the infertile or safe period . The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author : It involves no frustration of nature's laws , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them . With the exception of the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches , most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives , allowing the couple free choice ."

cj54_1," To speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment . At the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line . Their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life . And perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure . The storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds ."
cj54_3, . The general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree . Much which was in embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800 . In this process the Minoan-Mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected ; ; the Aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800 . Those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of Aegean development from earliest times -- granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside -- are correct ; ; but all too many observers have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took place in the early first millennium .
cj54_6," Further we cannot go , for the Dark ages deserve their name . Many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure . The epic poems , the consolidation of the Greek pantheon , the rise of firm political units , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men -- all these had to await the progress of following decades . What we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search . These are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the Aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the Hellenic outlook , independent of outside forces ."
cj54_10," The modern student , who knows what was to come next , is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century . Not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis . Many potters clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted with radically new ideas ; ; the poet of the Iliad deliberately archaized . Although it is not possible to sunder old and new in this era , I shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee of the first stage of Greek civilization ."
cj54_11," On this principle of division I must postpone the evolution of sculpture , architecture , society , and politics ; ; for the developments in these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself . The growing contacts between Aegean and Orient are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of Hellenic culture after 750 . We shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections to the East as we consider Ripe Geometric pottery , the epic and the myth , and the religious evolution of early Greece ; ; the important point , however , is that these magnificent achievements , unlike those of later decades , were only incidentally influenced by Oriental models . The antecedents of Dipylon vases and of the Iliad lie in the Aegean past . Dipylon pottery the pottery of the first half of the eighth century is commonly called Ripe Geometric . The severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years , the Strong Geometric style of the late ninth century , display as firm a mastery of the principles underlying Geometric pottery ; ; but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance . The vases which resulted had different shapes , far more complex decoration , and a larger sense of style ."

Unconcerned , indifferent , unmotivated , the forest was simply there -- fighting man's depredations with more abundant growth and man's follies with its own musical evening laughter . Red man or white man , pacifist or killer , the forest would accept them all -- knowing that it could thrive equally well on slaughter and beneficence ; ; knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man ."

cj62_3," It cannot be said that our very first day in the Soviet Union turned out to be an ordinary one . On that cold , but bright , April day we were guests of your government in the reviewing stand of Red Square to witness the poeple's celebration for Yuri Gagarin and later on that day we attended the somewhat more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive palaces of the Kremlin . If we thus spent our very first day in the midst of a large number of your people honoring a new hero and a great national achievement , our last day , to us at least , was equally impressive and very moving , even though the crowds were absent and there was almost complete silence . We stood under a gigantic tree in the rolling country just outside of Moscow looking at silent flowers on the grave of a Russian poet and writer who cherished the love for his country to the point of foregoing the highest international honor . The grave , about half-way between his home and the blue turrets of a small church , rose above the forms and spaces of gently undisciplined pastures of green , the sounds of birds , the silence of other graves and the casual paths through small forests . Just yesterday we had met and talked with a living writer , a contemporary of the dead poet , who is known for his ability of manipulating his ideas and his craft more advantageously . But today we were aware of only two men . One had taken a flight into uncharted space , in the service of science , to return as a living hero . The other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted space of the human spirit . The flowers on his grave attested to the fact that he as well was somebody's hero ."
cd08_6," Furthermore , the middle number of the Lo Shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers , by reason of its central position ; ; it is also their mathematical mean , since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair , all of which equal 10 . In fact , the neat balance of these pairs , and their subtle equilibrium , would have had special meaning in the minds of the Old Chinese . For they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female , equating the two groups with the Yang and Yin principles in Nature ; ; and in this square , the respective pairs made up of large and small odd ( Yang ) numbers , and those composed of large and small even ( Yin ) numbers , were all equal to each other . Thus all differences were leveled , and all contrasts erased , in a realm of no distinction , and the harmonious balance of the Lo Shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis ."

cj39_3," But the quest for such an index goes on ceaselessly , with all manner of investors and speculators participating , ranging from the sedate institutional type virtually to the proverbial shoe-string operator , all seeking doggedly , studiously , daily -- and often nightly -- for the enchanting index that will foretell the eternal secret : Which way will the market move -- up or down ? ? It recalls to mind the quest of olden times for the fountain of youth , a quest heavily invested in , during the days of wooden ships . Just as heavily invested are the endeavors of multitudes of modern men who carry on the quest for the enchanting index . The quest offers careers . Much of this goes on in offices high up in Wall Street's lofty wind-swept towers ."
ch02_7," D . Encouraging self-help 1 . The reasons for stressing self-help A systematic approach to development budgeting and programing is one important kind of self-help . There are many others . It is vitally important that the new U.S. aid program should encourage all of them , since the main thrust for development must come from the less developed countries themselves . External aid can only be marginal , although the margin , as in the case of the Marshall plan , can be decisive . External aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help . U.S. aid , therefore , should increasingly be designed to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take . Aid advice is not interference . In establishing conditions of self-help , it is important that we not expect countries to remake themselves in our image . Open societies can take many forms , and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals . On the other hand , it is no interference with sovereignty to point out defects where they exist , such as that a plan calls for factories without power to run them , or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them . Once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned with a country's development potential , we can be blunt in suggesting the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur . 2 . The range of self-help The major areas of self-help are the following : ( A ) the effective mobilizing of resources ."

ch05_16, The most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the State take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property . An adequately staffed and equipped State assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout the State . A single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different and independent assessing units '' .
cj37_5," From the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results . In the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving fundamental , and sometimes bitter , differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance . In the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence , but in a system where there is as yet no place for the less prominent . Lacking the respected and effective institutions that consensus helps provide , minority parties , such as the P.D.I. in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction in 1958 , clamor for elections when out of power , but are not at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power . Those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process . The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in Morocco ."
cj37_8," The Chamber of Commerce elections were , of course , an important event in the preparation for rural commune elections . The U.N.F.P. learned that its urban organization , which depends heavily on U.M.T. support , was most effective . The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete , precise problems of internal politics . The overall effect was probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than might have otherwise taken place ."
cj08_3," The biological and physical properties of infectious particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen years . Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional characteristics . Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling and assesment techniques . Much of the older experimental work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial procedures . The intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure , through natural respiration , to aerosolized organisms ."
cj08_9," Figure 1 describes the results obtained in this trial . The particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some 450 miles . From these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34,000 square miles was covered . These dosages could have been increased by increasing the source strength which was small in this case ."
cj08_13," As can be seen from Figure 2 , an extensive area was covered by this aerosol . The maximum distance sampled was 23 miles from the source . As can be seen from these dosage isopleths , approximately 100 square miles was covered within the area sampled . It is quite likely that an even greater area was covered , particularly downwind . The dosages in the three levels of the vertical profile were : Af"

cf03_19," Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy . We know that the number of radio and television impulses , sound waves , ultra-violet rays , etc. , that may occupy the very same space , each solitary upon its own frequency , is infinite . So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal , apparently momentary states of matter , successive one after another in consciousness , but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies . This theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness ."
cj64_3," Pimen is an old man , weak in body -- his voice rarely rises to a full forte -- but firm and clear of mind . His calmness offers contrast to Grigori's youthful excitement .

cj64_13," Curiously , this scene is a close parallel to one that Verdi was writing at the same time , the scene between Amonasro and Aida . Rangoni and Amonasro have the same purpose -- forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her country's cause -- and their tactics are much the same . Rangoni begins by describing the sad state of the Church ; ; this brings a reaction of distress from Marina . The music becomes ethereal as he calls up a vision of her own sainthood : it is she , he tells her , who can bring the truth to Russia and convert the heretics . As if in a trance , she repeats his words -- then realizes , with a shock , her own audacity . This is no assignment for a frivolous girl , she assures him ."

cn09_51," McBride staggered into the street , flopped sprawling in the stinging dust . Fear-maddened , fleeing the lengthening shadow of death , he scrambled to his feet again . He couldn't see ; ; he was long past the point of coherent thinking . Dimly , he heard laughter , hoots of derision , but he could not read the racket properly . He could not grasp that Lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago , and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air ."
cl04_21," A foolish thought came into his head . He remembered a story he had read as a youth . It was probably one of Kipling's tales of the British Army . It concerned an officer who had been disgraced and drummed out .

The day's rain had been added to the stagnant water . He was trapped on the road when he heard the sound of an approaching car . It was coming toward him . The car was now in sight . Marty's heart skipped a beat when he recognized it . It was the station wagon that had passed his cab on the road , the station wagon that had been parked at the Burch farm . Acey Squire's station wagon . It had headed back toward Jarrodsville . That had only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road . Now Acey and his friends were returning to seek him out ."

ck16_10," The horse shied at the dreadful thing and flared its nostrils . David took a firm hand with it . The creature in feathers looked around and David saw the mad eyes , glazed with an insane fear . The ungainly bird thing ran away , and to David its croaking sounded like the crowing of a tormented rooster . Then it was gone . He drove on , wary and shaken . The Sons were out tonight ."
cg71_11," And when Vincent Berger returns to Europe , this first result of his encounters with mankind is considerably enriched and deepened by a crucial revelation . For a dawning sense of illumination occurs in consequence of two events which , as so often in Malraux , suddenly confront a character with the existential question of the nature and value of human life . One such event is the landing in Europe itself , when the mingled familiarity and strangeness of the Occident , after the blank immensities of Asia , shocks the returning traveller into a realization of the infinite possibilities of human life ."
cc15_29," Pleasure boating is just scooting into its best months in California as crisp breezes bring out craft of every size on every kind of water -- ocean , lake and reservoir . Shore facilities are enormous -- Los Angeles harbors 5,000 boats , and Long Beach 3,000 -- but marinas are crowded everywhere . New docks and ramps are being rushed at Playa Del Rey , Ventura , Dana Point , Oceanside and Mission Bay ."
ca27_25," He also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany , with the result that it became the best selling camera in the German market ."
ck11_2," Now the face was his own . He wondered what expression , as he made that gesture , was on his face . He wondered if it wore the old anxiety , or the old , taut stoicism . But there was no need , he remembered , for his hand to reach out , for his face to show concern or stoicism . It was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came . Then why was he assuming the role -- the gesture and the suffering ? ? What was he expiating ? ? Or was he now taking the role -- the gesture and the suffering -- because it was the only way to affirm his history and identity in the torpid , befogged loneliness of this land ."
ca20_24," The atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp. . Thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said ."

ce10_2," Bill Ruger's long-awaited Deerstalker ( under $110 ) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of high-velocity fans ; ; it's a short , light , quick-handling , fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game -- whitetail ."
ce10_13," Hunting rifles , '61 The fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models , actions and calibers . Aside from the Ruger carbine , a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time . Here are the brands ( in alphabetical order ) and the new models ."
ce10_24," Magnum Rim-Fire rifles , 1961's lone newcomer was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader ( around $60 ) . Previously known as Jefferson Arms , Kodiak has given this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design , and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle"
cr07_15, The children looked at each other and sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever . Their curiosity went happily out of bounds .
cr07_37," He liked children , in a loathsome kind of way ; ; the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment . When he had left , I could never remember whether he had poked them in their middles , laughingly , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look . The children loathed him , too ."
ce17_6," The wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard Af and Af of a good grade , free from structural faults . They should be as straight as possible , as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are erected . The outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood , plastic coated panel board , high density particle board , asbestos-cement board , or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer . The inner panels do not have to be weatherproof , and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired . All panel board comes in standard Af foot size . It is recommended that panels be both glued as well as nailed to the frame . The fixed window panels with louvers should have a good grade of 1 double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing compound . The louvers are constructed as shown in the detail , with a drop door for ventilation . There are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them . The door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade . The filler panels for the gable ends are cut from full Af sheets as shown , leaving no wastage . The battens covering the joints are of Af stock and are applied after the walls are erected . All nails should be rustproof , and aluminum is highly recommended . Note : If 1 panel board is used inside and out , or 5 one side and 3 the other , and 1 glass is used , stock lumber in Af , Af , and Af can be used in making the glass panels . Other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special size lumber for the glass trim . In any case , there is no special milling or rabbeting required for the panels ."
ce28_2," Given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yrs. ? ? Based on our experience with clients , , we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups -- the market place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management ."
ce28_45," If companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke , then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade ."
ce21_1," Begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible . These are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies . The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site . These are inexpensive and available from the U. S. Geological Society , Washington 25 , D. C. . In recent years many counties and the U. S. Forest Service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use . Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor's office showing ownerships of land ."
cg14_0," There were fences in the old days when we were children . Across the front of a yard and down the side , they were iron , either spiked along the top or arched in half circles . Alley fences were made of solid boards higher than one's head , but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them . Side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses ; ; front fences were covered with Virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle . Square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of cast-iron foliage ; ; they were topped by steeples complete in every detail : high-pitched roof , pinnacle , and narrow gable . On these posts the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang ."
ca42_25," The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's health , welfare , and labor activities ."
ca42_28," Over the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-American course . Individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from Michigan , soft-shell crabs from Maryland , oysters from Washington , grapefruit from Florida . But plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late Sen. Fred Dubois of Idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the Senate's stomach was in the right place ."
cp03_34," There was an idea . Miss Kizzie had been right snippy ever since they were married , though you'd have thought a namesake would have brought her round . Oh , she'd come to see them once , left silver teething rings for all of the trips . But when Miss Jen went over right away to return the call , Miss Kiz couldn't have been very cordial , for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there . More and more , these days , she'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her , over to Tillie's and Nick's -- his own old square frame box on posts , chickens and cats and pups under the house , everybody friendly inside , making a to-do over the babies dressed like dollies . Though he was glad she got on well with his young folks , she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land , too ."
ce19_26," Preserving the pool A sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight . You need more chlorine . The walls feel slippery . You need algaecide . With or without professional help , you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse ."

cc13_30," The Parks Department has done an admirable job of preparing the Wollman Rink for Shakespeare . One could hardly blame Newbold Morris , the Parks Commissioner , for devoting so much grateful mention to the department's technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms , its balcony , its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains ."

ck17_21," Andrei stopped at Litowski Place and looked around quickly at the boundary of civil buildings . His watch told him he was still early . Down the boulevard he could see a portion of the ghetto wall . He found an empty bench , opened a newspaper , and stretched his legs before him . Krakow Boulevard was filled with black Nazi uniforms and the dirty brownish ones of their Auxiliaries ."

Annapolis , Jan. 7 -- The Anne Arundel county school superintendent has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what ."
ca19_67," Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units , in two-story and three-story structures . Various of the apartments are of the terrace type , being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct . Others , which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs , have balconies ."
cg70_7," At about the age of twelve I became a Spencerian liberal , and I have always considered myself a liberal of some kind even though the definition has changed repeatedly since Spencer became a reactionary . Several times in my youth I voted the Socialist ticket , but less because I was Socialist than because I was not either a Republican or a Democrat , and I voted for Franklin Roosevelt every time he was a candidate . Yet during the years when I was on the staff of The Nation , I tried to the limit the patience of the editors on almost every occasion when I was permitted to write an editorial having a bearing on a political or social question ."
ca26_3," In fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares . Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers ."

ca10_41," The changes , unanimously adopted , were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the Bible . The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the Bible ."
ca28_8," Dealers' stocks down With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country's farm equipment manufacturers . For example , farm equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed about 5% above a year earlier , Mr. Keeler reports ."
ca28_24, The Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a year-old I.R.S. ruling on the subject . The Service has not said what its next step will be .
ck26_2," So Linda Kay gave up asking , and accepted her reprieve . Without saying so , she was really grateful ; ; for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced , and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby Joe's wife . She had made curtains for all the windows of her little house , and she had kept it spotless and neat , shabby as it was , and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe . She had done all the things she had promised herself she would do , but she had not thought of this . People died , she would have said , in hospitals , or in cars on the highway at night ."
cg41_20," Every First Family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship . For the Coolidges , it was Mr. and Mrs. Frank W. Stearns of Boston , Massachusetts , owners of a large department store . They seemed to be at the White House half the time . The butlers were amused because when the Stearns were there , the President would say grace at breakfast . If the Stearns were not there , grace would be omitted ."
ck19_6," Rector had no doubt that Hino would come back from the village bursting with information , ready to impart it with his customary gusto , liberally embellished with his active imagnation . When the telephone rang on the day after Hino went down to the village , Rector had a hunch it would be Hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return , for there were few telephones in the village and the phone in Rector's office rarely rang unless it was important . He was surprised to find Kayabashi's secretary on the other end of the line . He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi wanted . The oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries , the secretary said , businessmen from Tokyo for the most part , and Kayabashi wished to show them the mission . They had never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it ."
ck19_24," Rector was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall . It was rather a childish game , all in all , but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much . He was not sure what effect it would have , but that was really beside the point when you got right down to it . He was not going to lose the mission by default , and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little sight-seeing group to the mission , he was going to be in for a surprise ."
ca17_6," Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Chase announce the birth of a daughter , Sheila , on Wednesday in Mercy Hospital ."
ca17_31," Her day starts early , but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during May , which is National Salvation Army Week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , Mrs. Marr's office is always open and the welcome mat is out ."
ca43_24," That improvement is continuing . In the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 ."

ca43_62," Gradual , controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what President Kennedy wants . This may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products . It's an important clue to Washington thinking ."
ca43_63," Note , too , that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry ."
ca43_71," U.S. coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freight . Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting , narrow and very deep ."
ce20_0," Draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania . Any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years . Fortunately , it is the FHA which has arrived at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress . Even if you live above that line , the FHA will back you , for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged ."
ce20_2," Home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted . We know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable , and accurate controls assure the comfort we want ."
ce20_18," Consider it as a standby setup , at negligible cost , for those emergencies when the furnace quits , a blizzard holds up fuel delivery , or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don't want to start up your whole heating plant . What size conditioner ? ?"
cp05_2," She had been in Japan just one week . It was an alien land , and she hated it intensely ; ; she was already considering putting in rebellious requests for duty at San Diego , Bremerton , the Great Lakes , Pensacola -- any place the Navy had a hospital -- with a threat to resign her commission if the request were not granted . Anywhere would be better than the land of her ancestors ."
cp05_4," But she suffered in her off-duty hours . Such as now , when she sat at a table in the coffee shop at the Officers' Club , having coffee and a hamburger to sustain her until dinnertime . She had changed into a cocktail dress , and the whole evening should have been before her , but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck . This was one of the Navy's crossroads -- you find them all around the world . Ships from the West Coast rotated on six-month tours of duty with the Seventh Fleet , and Yokosuka was the Seventh Fleet's principal port for maintenance , upkeep and shore liberty . Sooner or later , all the gray Navy ships came in here ; ; if Tommy sat long enough , she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in San Diego and Long Beach . And she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back there ."
cp05_22," Doc Doolittle's scheduled appearance at captain's mast was a very unusual thing , because the discipline dispensed there is ordinarily for the young and immature , and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report . But the beer hall riot in Subic had been unusual , too , and Walt Perry was convinced that Doc had started it through some expert tactics in rabble rousing . Just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer didn't know . In his opinion , Doc had not grown up ."
cr01_5," However while in his cell awaiting trial for theft , Barco , in a fit of apprehension , made an attempt to take his own life . The attempt had failed because , when endeavoring to cut his wrists , this murderer of seven women had fainted at the sight of blood . The jail authorities -- attaching no particular significance to the episode -- offered Barco whisky to revive him ; ; but the old fellow , a lifelong teetotaler , refused it , and no more was thought of the matter ."
cr01_31," I sat and watched proceedings . There was to be roast chicken with dressing , giblet gravy , asparagus , new peas with a sprig of mint , creamed onions , and mashed potatoes -- all chosen , prepared , and cooked by Viola herself ."
cg23_25," Ideas need to be tested , and not merely by argument and debate . When some question arises in the medical field concerning cancer , for instance , we do not turn to free and open discussion as in a political campaign . We have recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist in the laboratory . The merits of the Salk anti-polio vaccine were not established on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorials , but in the laboratory and by tests in the field on thousands of children ."
ce11_1," The southward route was the classic run in California , and the most fashionable . His patronage on this stretch was made up largely of San Franciscans -- regulars , most of them , and trenchermen like himself . They did not complain at the inhuman hour of starting ( seven in the morning ) , nor of the tariff , which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco . Breakfast was at the Palace Hotel , luncheon was somewhere in the mountain forest , and dinner was either at Boulder Creek or at Santa Cruz ."
ce11_7," After the meal , he and his guests went out to inspect the rig ; ; this was merely a ritual , to please all hands concerned . The tallyho had cost Vernon $2,300 . A replica of two coaches made in England for the Belmont Club in the East , and matchless west of the Rockies , it was the despair of whips on the Santa Cruz run . One could shave in the reflection of its French-polished panels , and its axles were greased like those of roulette wheels . The horses were groomed to a high gloss ; ; departing , they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw , for they had been trained to drag at important funerals ."
ce11_11," omelet Arbogast Fry in butter a small minced onion , rub with a tablespoonful of flour , add half a cup of cream , six beaten eggs , pepper , celery salt , a teaspoonful of minced chives , a dash of cayenne , and a pinch of nutmeg . A jigger of dry Sherry follows , and as the mixture stiffens , in go a hundred of the little oysters ."
cp29_4," Probably Mr. Willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren . Gerry began to aid Freddy with her father , prodded , no doubt , by Joan's open contempt for Freddy and William's irritating competency . Another factor must have been the eventual disposal of Willis' fortune ; ; she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with Freddy , the more likely he was to reward Freddy richly upon his death ."
cp29_16," They took nearly a month to investigate , marshal statistics , and put their arguments down in black and white . Taking Hamrick with him , William went to Mr. Willis . He was surprised and dubious , but impressed by the engineer and the report ."
ce33_24," Now , check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections , around the freeze-out plugs , gaskets , water pump seals and heater fittings ."
ce33_27," Take precautions now , to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms this summer ."
cg01_6," I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North . In business circles , usually conservative , this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found . But in our case -- and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration , nor are we given to emotional outbursts -- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking several more . In fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south , because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down ."
cg01_11," Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors . All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; ; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did . Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending , the invasion , and Reconstruction ; ; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties . But apart from racial problems , the old unreconstructed South -- to use the moderate words favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith -- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North . And this , in effect , means most of modern America ."
cg39_7," This rather detached attitude toward life's encumbrances has seemed to be the dominant trait in Mercer's personality ever since . It is , however , a disarming disguise , or perhaps a shield , for not only has Mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the years , but also one who can function remarkably under pressure . He has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer ( his records have sold in the millions ) and is a sharp businessman ."
ce34_2," A volume market According to a recent Wall Street Journal survey , plastics units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales . Five years ago , they had only 10% of the market , with the remainder firmly entrenched in the stronghold of neon tubing . And it's far from the end for plastics . Industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during the 1960's will be of plastic construction . Evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies in the field as Advance Neon Sign Co. , Los Angeles , Calif. . Four years ago , the company's entire line was devoted to neon signs ; ; today , 85% is in plastics ."
ce34_8," They offer exceptional design freedom , making it possible to incorporate contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer . Vacuum- and pressure-formed sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded plastics . Pre-decoration , low-cost molds , and the freedom to form large and small , thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the industry . 4 ."
ce34_15," A relative newcomer in outdoor signs is Mylar polyester film , now used as a printed overlay for trans-illuminated signs ( see below ) ."
cp18_15," After I looked in at Francie , I went into the living room and waited . I must have dozed off , because I came to with a start at the sound of voices . Nadine's , shrill with anger -- Wally's loud and thick -- As I went to the door I heard the clock strike two . I opened the door , and Wally stumbled in -- fast -- as if Nadine had pushed him ."
cp18_39," Then Wally got sick . To my way of thinking , he was scared sick . His luck had failed him , and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world ."
cp18_47," And I couldn't take six more weeks of this . I mentioned it to Chris one stifling hot night , when I had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air ."
cg08_1," Nostalgic Yankee readers of Erskine Caldwell are today informed by proud Georgians that Tobacco Road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway , over which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the Dow-Jones average than with the cotton crop . Thus we are compelled to face the urbanization of the South -- an urbanization which , despite its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the Southern culture , has been utterly ignored by the bulk of Southern writers . Indeed , it seems that only in today's Southern fiction does Tobacco Road , with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint juleps , continue to live -- but only as a weary , overexploited phantom ."
cp20_9," And so off we went to her apartment . She was a nymphomaniac , of course , the poor girl . Toward the break of day I waxed philosophical , and drew analogies about her way of eating bread and cheese ."
cp20_11," I got there on a Saturday evening . I made the mistake of going to the Jour et Nuit . The place was busy but I didn't feel like a Hun . I sat waiting for Life to come along and sweep me up . I had part of a bottle of French beer called Panther Pils ( so help me ) , then switched to Tuborg . After a few hours , Life hadn't showed , and I was crocked . I went to my hotel and slept . The next morning a little cognac made me feel better -- but what can you do in Paris on Sunday morning ? ? So I drank more cognac ."

cg37_25," Six The first act of Adoniram and Samuel on reaching Calcutta was to report at the police station , a necessity when landing in East India Company territory . On the way they tried to discover all they could about Burma , and they were disturbed to find that Michael Symes's book had not presented an altogether true picture . He had failed to realize that the Burmese were not really treating him as the important visitor he considered himself . They were in fact quietly laughing at him , for their King wished to have nothing to do with the Western world . When Captain John Gibault of Salem had visited Burma in 1793 his ship , the Astra , had been promptly commandeered and taken by her captors up the Irrawaddy River . Although after much trouble he did manage to get it back , he discovered there was no trade to be had . All Captain Gibault took back to Salem were a few items for the town's East India Museum . A year later another Salem ship returned from Burma with a cargo of gum lacquer which nobody wanted to buy . After that Salem ships decided to bypass unfriendly Burma ."
cg37_29, They explained that they desired only to stop in India until a ship traveling on to Burma could be found .
ca35_2," There is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture . Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university . But the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American Catholic project ; ; certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy ."
cc07_3," Mr. Paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic elements of the score . He did not let the strings , for instance , weep , whine or get hysterical . His interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy ."
cc07_6," Taken as a whole , though , it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra . Mr. Skolovsky fully deserved the warm reception he received ."
ck04_3," Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked the city over ; ; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were . Beyond were industries and factories . Then they went down to Black Bottom . In the midst of this crowded region was the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church . It was an old and dirty wooden structure , sadly in need of repair . But it was a landmark . It had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town , black and white , knew of it . It had just suffered a calamity , the final crisis in a long series of calamities .

cc09_30," Not content to create only the music and lyrics , Noel Coward also wrote the book and directed Sail Away ( Capitol WAO 1643 ; ; stereo SWAO 1643 ) , a saga of life on a cruise ship that is not apt to be included among Mr. Coward's more memorable works . The melodies flow along pleasantly , as Mr. Coward's songs usually do , but his lyrics have a tired , cut-to-a-familiar-pattern quality . Elaine Stritch , who sings with a persuasively warm huskiness , belts some life into most of her songs , but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm as Mr. Coward's songs ."

cg65_1," Often the historian must consider the use of intuition or instinct by those individuals or nations which he is studying . Unconsciously , governments or races or institutions may enter into some undertaking without fully realizing why they are doing so . They react in obedience to an instinct or urge which has itself been impelled by natural law . A court may strike down a law on the basis of an intuitive feeling that the law is inimical to the numerical majority . A nation may go to war on some trifling pretext , when in reality it may have been guided by an unconscious instinct that its very life was at stake . When the historian encounters a situation in which he can perceive no visible cause and effect sequence , he should be alert to intuition and unconscious instinct as possible guides ."

If Mr. Kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals , if his analysis of how Western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic -- well , the record itself is not too encouraging ."
cc06_16," Two criticisms of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges -- there is no mention of the Potsdam Conference or the Morgenthau Plan . And in a concluding chapter about America's stance in the contemporary world , one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come to grips with the baffling riddle of our time : How to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war ."
cc06_18," This is the tale of one John Enright , an American who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man . But Innesfree , where Ellen Roe Danaher and her bullying brother , Will , live , is no place for a man who will not use his fists . So Enright's courting of the mettlesome Ellen is impeded considerably , thereby providing the tale which is told . You may be sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother , and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word Donnybrook means ."

For Mrs. Shaefer -- who had been given a clean bill of health by her own physician at the time she visited Lee -- and her friend were agents for the California Pure Food and Drug Inspection Bureau . And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence of Lee's quack shenanigans , gathered by the tape recorder under her friend's clothing , proved adequate in court for convicting Franklin D.

cf17_10," At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided to cast their lot with the United States , and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling . The disasters of 1825-1826 caused more to leave . After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice , snow fell on October 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick . In April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-June . On June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip across the plains to the Mississippi . By fall , 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling , but most of them were sent on to Galena and St. Louis , with a few going as far as Vevay , Indiana , a notable Swiss center in the United States . In 1837 , 157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at Fort Snelling ."

cf21_13," Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific , but only one was of any consequence . On November 4 , 1952 , an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula . At 17:07 that afternoon ( Greenwich time ) the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu . The warning system immediately went into action . Within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in Alaska , Arizona and California , the quake's epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude . While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the Pacific ( Midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ) , the Hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time ."
cf21_19," Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface , but they do not occur at greater depths . Two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts . ( 1 ) As far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks do . ( 2 ) If earthquakes do occur at such depths , why not deeper ? ?"
cd13_3," Now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world . But we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen bomb . Hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce . We know that we have hydrogen in water ; ; water is Af and the H stands for hydrogen ; ; there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies . I have calculated that if I could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body , I would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on Hiroshima . I won't try the experiment , but I think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go , there would be quite an explosion . And then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in Delaware Bay or in the ocean beyond . Salt water is still Af , the same hydrogen is there . And the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today ."
cd13_12," Music of the spheres Now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture . For we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics ; ; and therefore the atom was really just a little machine ; ; and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts . So if you are made of atoms , you are just a big machine ; ; and since the universe is also made of atoms , it is just a supermachine . And this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe , governed by the laws of cause and effect , bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom . And this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists ."
cj79_0," The set of all decisions is called the operating policy or , more simply , the policy . An optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product . There are thus three components to an optimal design problem : ( 1 ) The specification of the state of the process stream ; ; ( 2 ) The specification of the operating variables and the transformation they effect ; ; ( 3 ) The specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired . For a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species , and the temperature or pressure of the stream . For the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied ; ; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter . The objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing ; ; it is the subject of Chapter 4 ."
cj79_2," To see how important this economy is , let us suppose that there are M operating variables at each stage and that the state is specified by N variables ; ; then the search for the maximum at any one stage will require a number of operations of order Af ( where a is some number not unreasonably large ) . To proceed from one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated to allow for interpolation ; ; this number will be of the order of Af . If , however , we are seeking the optimal R-stage policy for a given feed state , only one search for a maximum is required at the final step . Thus a number of operations of the order of Af are required . If all the operating variables were varied simultaneously , Af operations would be required to do the same job , and as R increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations required by the dynamic program . But even more important than this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy , namely , that for the given feed state and R stages . In contrast , the dynamic program produces this policy and a whole family of policies for any smaller number of stages . If the problem is enlarged to require a complete coverage of feed states , Af operations are needed by the dynamic program and Af by the direct search . But Af is vastly larger than R . No optimism is more baseless than that which believes that the high speed of modern digital computers allows for use of the crudest of methods in searching out a result . Suppose that Af , and that the average operation requires only Af sec. . Then the dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would take more than three millennia ! !"
cj79_8," For any choice of admissible policy Af in the first stage , the state of the stream leaving this stage is given by Af . This is the feed state of the subsequent Af stages which , according to the principle of optimality , must use an optimal Af-stage policy with respect to this state . This will result in a value Af of the objective function , and when Af is chosen correctly this will give Af , the maximum of the objective function . Thus Af where the maximization is over all admissible policies Af , and Af is related to Af by ( 5 ) . The sequence of equations ( 6 ) can be solved for Af when Af is known , and clearly Af , the maximization being over all admissible Af ."
cj79_12," 2.3 the discrete stochastic process The process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only statistically is also of interest , although for chemical reactor design it is not as important as the deterministic process . In this case the stage R operating with conditions Af transforms the state of the stream from Af to Af , but only the probability distribution of Af is known . This is specified by a distribution function Af such that the probability that Af lies in some region D of the stage space is Af ."
cn25_29," At last he reached for the knife . Even the bone handle scorched , and he retrieved the marine's handkerchief to wrap it . First he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes . The marine yelled and flung the hand away . With a firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek . A shrill yelp , kicked legs , and groping hands that circled Matsuo's wrist . Matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat ; ; burned the other cheek ; ; burned each hand when they came groping again .

But even before he started across the oiled road to his Plymouth , parked in the lot under the cypress trees across from the station , he knew that he wasn't going home ."
cd14_3," What in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation . As we have seen , a growing proportion , although in 1914 still a minority , were members of churches . Presumably those who did not have a formal church connexion had also felt the influence of Christianity to a greater or lesser extent . Many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in Christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse . The form of Christianity to which they were exposed was for some the Protestantism of the older stock , for others the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration ; ; for still others , mostly of the nineteenth-century immigration , it was Roman Catholicism , and for a small minority it was Eastern Orthodoxy . Upon all of them played the intellectual , social , political , and economic attitudes , institutions , and customs of the nation . Upon most of these Christianity had left an impress and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was . Yet to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual showed the effects of Christianity would be impossible . At best only an approximation could be arrived at . To generalize for the entire nation would be absurd . For instance , we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to Christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose . The temptation is to say that , as the percentage of church members mounted , the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level . Yet this cannot be proved . We know that in the early part of the century many Protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed . Thus Baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness , fighting , malicious gossip , lying , cheating , sexual irregularities , gambling , horse racing , and failure to pay just debts . If guilty , the offender might be excluded from membership . As church membership burgeoned , such measures faded into desuetude . But whether this was accompanied by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know ."

cj12_2," Discussion It is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made . The significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined . However , the dynamics of airflow , from morphologic considerations alone , may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse . The volume and , perhaps , even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse . Also , interlobular air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow ; ; probably occur in the horse much as in the human being ; ; and , in contrast , are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent ( Van Allen and Lindskog , '31 ) .

ch29_12," In sum , I look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 , with total sales increasing about 7% to $10.8 billion , despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally . As I have indicated above , I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year , but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960 ; ; on prospects for continued increases in defense spending ; ; and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960's ."

cf44_8," It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends -- expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings . These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis . Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions . The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized ; ; the schism between central city and suburb , Negro and White , blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis . It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings . The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations . This conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment . More than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples ."
cj23_0," 2 : : Some of the major functions of religion The place of religion in the simple , preliterate societies is quite definite ; ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly in every part of it . In societies like ours , however , its place is less clear and more complex . With the diversity of religious viewpoints , there are differences of opinion as to the essential features of religion ; ; and there are different opinions as to the essential functions of religion . Nevertheless , for most of the population of heterogeneous advanced societies , though less for the less religious portion , religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions ."
cj40_7," By the end of the spring of 1961 , assuming that a general business recovery gets under way , interest rates should begin to edge upward again , depending upon the vigor of the recovery and the determination with which the monetary authorities move to restrain credit availability . My guess would be that interest rates will decline moderately into the spring of 1961 and during the second half of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during the downturn ."
cf27_8," A few red wines , notably those of the Beaujolais , are better consumed at cellar temperature . By tradition , a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature -- if anything a little cooler -- and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well . Thus , red wine must , if possible , never be disturbed or shaken ; ; very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering , bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself . A tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea . The cork should be pulled gradually and smoothly , and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward ."
cf27_10," In France , when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines , one visits the restaurant well ahead of time , chooses the wines and , with the advice of the manager and his chef , builds the menu around them . The wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate , preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and , perhaps in the case of very old wines , be decanted . Decanting old wine aerates it fully ; ; it may also be -- practically speaking -- a matter of good economy . For , in the process of decanting , the bottle is only tilted once instead of several or more times at the table : hence , a minimum of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs ."
cf27_11," Though there are many exceptions , which we have noted in preceding pages , white wine is as a rule best consumed between two and six years old , and red wines , nowadays , between three and ten . Red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer ; ; the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite number , red Burgundy . Some clarets do not come into their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age , or even more . If a red Bordeaux of a good name and year is bitter or acid , or cloying and muddy-tasting , leave it alone for a while . Most of the wines of Beaujolais , on the other hand , should be drunk while very young ; ; and Alsatians may be ."
cn23_18," He knew how to shoot down Nazis . And he knew that the men talked about him behind his back , saying that he was one up on everybody else -- including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it -- because he was chemically incapable of fear . That was true , but only half the truth . The other half he didn't like to recognize , even to himself . He enjoyed the killing . Not defending England , or being an ace , or fighting for humanity . He enjoyed killing . And he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a Nazi ."
cd12_20," One of the roles of the social scientist , ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work . But responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional , white , American good . Such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world , let us say a community , that embraces Scarsdale or Yonkers , but is also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive ."
cj78_4," An electrostatic system suffers generally from image plane curvature leading to defocusing in the peripheral image region if a flat viewing screen ( or interstage coupler ) is utilized , while a magnetic system requires accurate adjustment of the solenoid , which is heavy and bulky . As it will be discussed later , peripheral defocusing can be improved on by utilizing curved fiber couplers . It should be noted , however , that the paraxial resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems ."
cj78_5," It is felt that fiber-coupled double- ( and multi- ) stage image intensifiers will gain considerable importance in the future . Therefore , we shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities of such tubes . The luminous efficiency and resolution of single stages , fiber couplers , and finally of the composite tube will be computed ."
cj78_16," As the index of refraction of photosensitive surfaces of the SbCs-type lies around 2 , the Fresnel losses at the fiber-photocathode interface are about 0.5 percent and the Af factor for the interstage coupler is 0.95 . It might be anticipated that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further ."
cj78_18," The packing efficiency , F.R. , of fiber plates did not receive much attention in the literature , probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally used , until rather recently . For circular fibers in a closely packed hexagonal array , the packing efficiency is given by : Af where Af , and 0.906 is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the circumscribed hexagon . For the small diameter fibers now technically feasible and required for about 100 Af resolution , Af . The cladding thickness is about 0.5 M , hence , Af and Af ."
cn15_39," Wingman , stay clear , he prayed . He pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back . He fought the panic of vertigo . He had no idea which was up and which was down . He held the controls where they had been . Sweat popped out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip . His air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out ."
cj71_9," Conceivably the submarine defense problem can be solved by sufficient forces . Numbers would be astronomical and current fiscal policies make this an impractical solution . Shipbuilding , aircraft procurement , and weapon programs indicate that there will not be enough of anything . Therefore , any measures taken in peacetime which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute greatly to success when hostilities occur . Therefore , the sixth principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures which will reduce future force requirements ."
cl18_19," There was no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room , his imagination out of control . He tried to tell himself that maybe Burton had sobered up enough to get some sense . Maybe he only intended to scare the blackmailer , whoever he was , in which case an unloaded gun would be good enough . He thought of other possibilities , none of them satisfactory , and finally he began to think , to wonder if there was some way he could reach Burton . Then , as he turned toward the telephone , it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly ."
cl18_40," He hung up with a bang , annoyed at himself for running off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation he had helped to create . As soon as he could think logically again he reached for the telephone directory and found Jerry Burton's home number . He dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up . He called the bar and grill where he had picked Burton up that afternoon . When he was told that no one had seen Burton since then , he thought of three other places that were possibilities . Each time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up ."
cf16_4," Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations . First , they wanted to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma . Second , they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain -- a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps , on American towns and counties , on a great American river , and on half a million square miles of Arctic seas ."
cf16_12," In 1602 , George Waymouth , in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded , had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back . Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway ."
cj49_3," There is currently a major controversy of public education in which group interests and values are heavily engaged . This is the issue of segregated schools in the South . In this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial groups rather than social-class groups . Thus , the white middle and lower classes are arrayed against the Negro middle and lower classes . This conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white middle-class people better than it suits white lower-class people . If this happens , there may be some class conflict in the South , with school boards and school teachers taking the middle-class position ."
cf45_2," In accord with its penurious policy , the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians . The lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the Indian trade of New France and Louisiana in the previous century , and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men . Traders from the English colonies were far more generous , and Indian loyalty turned to them . Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded , and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company ."
cf45_7," Only two principal storehouses were actually established -- one at Mobile , the other at New Orleans . New Orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi , and west of that river , and on the Ohio and Wabash . Mobile was also supplied by New Orleans with goods for the Mobile district ."
cf45_17," With the loss of the Mobile trade , which ended all profits from Louisiana , the Natchez Indians revolted . They destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods , and harassed French shipping on the Mississippi . The war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts . In January , 1731 , the company asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony . It stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations , and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade . It offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade , but asked an indemnity . The King accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the company at 1,450,000 livres . Thenceforth , the commerce of Louisiana was free to all Frenchmen ."
cb21_13," The lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups , from which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn . But more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem . Its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing . An illustration of this attitude is found in John A. McCone's letter to Dr. Thomas Lauritsen , reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of The New Republic ."
cb21_18," Assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the Japanese at 10 megatons , a conservative computation is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60 megatons . Some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to 80 megatons , and that the full 50-megaton bomb that Khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated ."
ch28_1," Musical activities the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life . Extensive facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining , under skilled direction , the Choir , the Orchestra , the Band , the Glee Club , and smaller ensembles of wind and string players ."
ch28_5," Religious activities from the founding of the College those responsible for its management have planned to provide its students favorable conditions for personal religious development and to offer opportunities through the curriculum and otherwise for understanding the meaning and importance of religion . Courses are offered in ethics , the philosophy and history of religion , Christian thought and history , and the Bible . Carleton aims throughout its entire teaching program to represent a point of view and a spirit which will contribute to the moral and religious development of its students ."
ch28_36," In January , 1960 , the first issue of The Carleton Miscellany , a quarterly literary magazine , was published by the College . The magazine , edited by members of the Carleton Department of English , includes contributions by authors from both within and beyond the Carleton community ."
cb26_30," Truly , that Liberals should choose Louis 14 , as a bogey-symbol of conservatism is grotesquely ironic , considering the Louis 14 , character of their Grand Monarque , FDR : not only in his accretion of absolute power and personal deification , ( le roi gouverne par lui meme ) , but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies ."
cb19_5, Two wrongs to the editor of the Inquirer : I suppose I am missing some elementary point but I honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right ! ! I am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because Russia is . Will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children ? ? If an atom bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it .
cb19_23, This can be accomplished by several logical steps : ( 1 ) Widen the East River Drive at least one lane . ( 2 ) So widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems . ( 3 ) Paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges . One additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the East River Drive by fifty percent . ( 4 ) This could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the Schuylkill Expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the East River Drive .
ch17_5," This is a prosecution for refusal to be inducted into the armed services , in violation of the provisions of the Universal Military Training and Service Act , 62 Stat. 604,622 , 50 , U.S.C. App. Aj 462 ( A ) . Petitioner , who claims to be a conscientious objector , contends that he was denied due process , both in the proceedings before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice and at trial . He says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing officer statements attributed to him by the local board , and , further , that he was denied at trial the right to have the Department of Justice hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim -- all in violation of the Fifth Amendment . The trial judge decided that the administrative procedures of the Act were fully complied with and refused to require the production of such documents . Petitioner was found guilty and sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment . The Court of Appeals affirmed . 269 F. 2d 613 . We granted certiorari in view of the importance of the questions in the administration of the Act . 361 U. S. 899 . We have concluded that petitioner's claims are controlled by the rationale of Gonzales v. United States , 348 U.S. 407 ( 1955 ) , and United States v. Nugent , 346 U.S. 1 ( 1953 ) , and therefore affirm the judgment ."
cj13_4," Onsets , Completions , and Skeletal Ages ( Hand ) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those Skeletal Ages which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion Profile . It may be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small , according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body . Accordingly , maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence . It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings , but there is substantial agreement . Since a Skeletal Age rating can be made at any age during growth , from Elbow , Shoulder , Knee , or Foot as well as Hand , it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood . As stated earlier in the paper , Onsets and Completions -- particularly the former -- provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development , each within a limited age period . Such an indicator , or indicators , are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress ."
ch21_11," A substantial increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense program , as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential . Also , the program for fleet modernization will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures . Further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year ."
ch21_24," These examples underscore the importance of even more searching evaluations of new major development programs and even more penetrating and far-ranging analyses of the potentialities of future technology . The cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development , in determining the most satisfactory rate of development , and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it ."
ch19_17," The first year's projects should also be spread through several countries in Latin America , Africa and Asia ."
ch19_23," The already appropriated funds within the discretion of the President and Secretary of State under the Mutual Security Act are the only immediately available source of financing this summer's pilot programs of the Peace Corps . If it is decided to make a small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance funds , in order to carry out the purposes of the Mutual Security Act through this new peaceful program , this will be a hopeful sign to the world . Congress should then be asked to give the Peace Corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year ."
ch26_11," The new work was a boon to the partnership , not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of J. R. Brown toward yet further developments for production equipment ."
